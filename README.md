You can ignore if there are problems, the important thing is that you still get missions and coins.
Can not login?
Maybe your Instagram account has been checkpointed or your Instagram account has been logged out.
Maybe you entered the wrong Like4Like cookies or Instagram cookies.
You must use Kiwi Browser and the Cookie Dough extension to log in successfully.
Didn't get any coins?
